    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground meat: This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.</li>
            <li>Seasonings and herbs: These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Cheese: You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Italian bread: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.</li>
            <li>Water: Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.</li>
            <li>Olive oil: Fry the meatballs in olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
