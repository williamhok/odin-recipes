        <p>
            The sauce in this amazing Indonesian curry might be invisible, but you'll know it's there. 
            As it reduces, the water evaporates, leaving behind the fat and flavor that make this dish so unique and addictive. 
            Originally, cooking meat this way helped preserve it in hot and humid Indonesia. 
            Turns out, people continued making it long after refrigeration came around. Serve with steamed rice, garnished with cilantro and lime if desired.
